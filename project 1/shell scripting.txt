PROJECT 1 - Shell Scripting:
Creating a shell script containing a sequence of Linux commands and execute it.

What is shell scripting?

A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. It is called a shell script because it combines a sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script
